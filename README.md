## Performance testing skeleton

This is a skeleton netty that tests OpenSSL performance vs JDKSSL.

It defines 3 endpoints:

- `empty` -- just returns a 200
- `ping` -- returns the text pong
- `file` -- returns a file generated by the build

It takes the following parameters:

- `-Ptype=XXX` -- where XXX is the endpoint name from above
- `-Pjdk` -- to use the JDK SSL provider instead of the OpenSSL one
- `-Psize=XX` -- where XX is the size in MB for the file endpoint

To run the `empty` test, the `file` test with a 5MB payload and the `file` test with a 20MB payload, you just need to execute the `runProfiling.sh` bash script.

JMeter result dashboards will be created in `build/jmeter-reports`
